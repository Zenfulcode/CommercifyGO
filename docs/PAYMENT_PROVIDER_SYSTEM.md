# PaymentProviderRepository System Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a PaymentProviderRepository system to replace the webhook repository approach. This new system provides a centralized way to manage all payment providers and their configurations, including webhook information.

## Key Components

### 1. Domain Layer

#### Payment Provider Entity (`internal/domain/entity/payment_provider.go`)
- **PaymentProvider**: Main entity representing a payment provider configuration
- Contains all provider details: type, name, description, methods, currencies, webhooks, etc.
- Includes validation and helper methods for JSON serialization
- Supports webhook configuration and external provider integration

#### Common Types (`internal/domain/common/payment_types.go`)
- **PaymentProviderType**: Enum for provider types (stripe, mobilepay, mock)
- **PaymentMethod**: Enum for payment methods (credit_card, wallet)
- Prevents circular imports between packages

#### Repository Interface (`internal/domain/repository/payment_provider_repository.go`)
- **PaymentProviderRepository**: Interface defining all payment provider operations
- Methods for CRUD operations, filtering by currency/method, webhook management
- Clean separation between domain and infrastructure

#### Service Interface (`internal/domain/service/payment_provider_service.go`)
- **PaymentProviderService**: Business logic interface for payment provider management
- Higher-level operations like enabling/disabling providers, webhook registration
- Integration with payment provider management

### 2. Infrastructure Layer

#### Repository Implementation (`internal/infrastructure/repository/gorm/payment_provider_repository.go`)
- GORM-based implementation of PaymentProviderRepository
- Advanced querying with JSON field support for arrays
- Proper error handling and validation

#### Service Implementation (`internal/infrastructure/payment/payment_provider_service.go`)
- Business logic implementation for payment provider management
- Default provider initialization
- Integration with repository layer

#### Updated Multi-Provider Service (`internal/infrastructure/payment/multi_provider_payment_service.go`)
- Now uses PaymentProviderRepository instead of hardcoded providers
- Dynamic provider discovery from database
- Improved separation of concerns

### 3. Application Layer

#### Dependency Injection (`internal/infrastructure/container/`)
- Updated RepositoryProvider to include PaymentProviderRepository
- Updated ServiceProvider to include PaymentProviderService
- Proper initialization order to prevent circular dependencies

### 4. Interface Layer

#### Payment Provider Handler (`internal/interfaces/api/handler/payment_provider_handler.go`)
- REST API endpoints for payment provider management
- Admin-only operations for enabling/disabling providers
- Webhook registration and configuration management
- CRUD operations with proper error handling

### 5. Server Integration (`internal/interfaces/api/server.go`)
- Automatic initialization of default payment providers on startup
- Integration with existing payment system
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Centralized Management**
- All payment provider configurations in one place
- Unified approach to webhook management
- Single source of truth for provider capabilities

### 2. **Database-Driven Configuration**
- Providers can be enabled/disabled without code changes
- Configuration changes persist across restarts
- Easy to add new providers without redeployment

### 3. **Clean Architecture Compliance**
- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Dependency inversion principle followed
- Easy to test and maintain

### 4. **Webhook Consolidation**
- Webhook information stored with provider configuration
- No separate webhook entities needed
- Simplified webhook management

### 5. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new payment providers
- Configurable priority system for provider selection
- Support for test/production mode switching

## Migration from Webhook Repository

### What Changed
- **Removed**: Separate WebhookRepository system
- **Added**: PaymentProviderRepository with integrated webhook support
- **Updated**: MultiProviderPaymentService to use repository
- **Enhanced**: Admin interface for provider management

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing payment flow remains unchanged
- API endpoints for getting payment providers work as before
- WebhookRepository kept for temporary compatibility

### Benefits
- **Reduced Complexity**: One system instead of two
- **Better Data Model**: Webhooks belong to providers naturally
- **Improved Admin Experience**: Single interface for all provider management
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Database-driven configuration

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/payment/providers` - Get available payment providers
- `GET /api/payment/providers?currency=NOK` - Get providers for specific currency

### Admin Endpoints (New)
- `GET /admin/payment-providers` - Get all payment providers
- `POST /admin/payment-providers/{providerType}/enable` - Enable/disable provider
- `PUT /admin/payment-providers/{providerType}/configuration` - Update configuration
- `POST /admin/payment-providers/{providerType}/webhook` - Register webhook
- `DELETE /admin/payment-providers/{providerType}/webhook` - Delete webhook
- `GET /admin/payment-providers/{providerType}/webhook` - Get webhook info

## Default Providers

The system automatically creates these default providers:

1. **Stripe**
   - Type: `stripe`
   - Methods: Credit Card
   - Currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, NOK, DKK, etc.
   - Status: Disabled (requires configuration)
   - Priority: 100

2. **MobilePay**
   - Type: `mobilepay`
   - Methods: Wallet
   - Currencies: NOK, DKK, EUR
   - Status: Disabled (requires configuration)
   - Priority: 90

3. **Mock (Test)**
   - Type: `mock`
   - Methods: Credit Card
   - Currencies: USD, EUR, NOK, DKK
   - Status: Enabled (for testing)
   - Priority: 10

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema**: GORM will automatically create the payment_providers table
2. **Configuration**: Update config files to specify enabled providers
3. **Testing**: Verify payment provider selection works correctly
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new endpoints
5. **Migration**: Eventually remove deprecated WebhookRepository

## Implementation Notes

- The system uses JSONB fields for storing arrays (methods, currencies, events)
- Proper indexes are in place for performance
- Error handling follows the project's patterns
- All operations are logged for debugging
- The priority field allows for intelligent provider selection

This implementation provides a solid foundation for managing payment providers in a scalable, maintainable way while following clean architecture principles.
