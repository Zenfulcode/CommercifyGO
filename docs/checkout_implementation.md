# Checkout System Implementation

## Completed Tasks

1. Created a new checkout entity in `/internal/domain/entity/checkout.go` with:
   - Basic checkout information (ID, user/session ID)
   - Checkout items
   - Shipping address and billing address  
   - Customer details
   - Shipping method and cost
   - Discount information
   - Payment provider
   - Status tracking (active, completed, abandoned, expired)
   - Expiration handling

2. Created a checkout repository interface in `/internal/domain/repository/checkout_repository.go` defining methods for:
   - CRUD operations
   - Guest checkout to user checkout conversion
   - Status-based queries (expired, active, completed)

3. Created database migration files:
   - `/migrations/000020_add_checkouts.up.sql` with tables for checkouts and checkout items
   - `/migrations/000020_add_checkouts.down.sql` for rollback

4. Implemented PostgreSQL repository in `/internal/infrastructure/repository/postgres/checkout_repository.go` with:
   - All repository interface methods
   - JSON handling for complex types (address, customer details)
   - Guest checkout to user checkout conversion
   - Proper transaction handling

5. Implemented checkout use case in `/internal/application/usecase/checkout_usecase.go` with business logic for:
   - Creating and retrieving checkouts
   - Managing items (add, update, remove)
   - Setting shipping/billing addresses
   - Setting customer details
   - Handling shipping methods and costs
   - Applying/removing discounts
   - Converting checkouts to orders
   - Managing checkout lifecycle (expiry, abandonment, completion)

6. Created checkout DTOs in `/internal/dto/checkout.go` for API communication with:
   - Checkout data transfer objects
   - Request/response structures for all checkout operations
   - Conversion between entity and DTO formats

7. Implemented checkout handler in `/internal/interfaces/api/handler/checkout_handler.go` with:
   - Authentication-aware endpoints (supports both guest and user checkouts)
   - Support for all checkout operations
   - Error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes
   - JSON serialization/deserialization

8. Updated dependency injection container:
   - Added checkout repository to repository provider
   - Added checkout use case to use case provider
   - Added checkout handler to handler provider

9. Configured API routes in `/internal/interfaces/api/server.go`:
   - Guest checkout routes
   - User checkout routes
   - Admin checkout routes

10. Created TypeScript client API methods for checkout operations

11. Created API documentation in `/docs/checkout_api_examples.md`
    - Comprehensive examples for all endpoints
    - Example workflows for both guests and authenticated users

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the checkout entity
   - Write unit tests for the checkout repository
   - Write unit tests for the checkout use case
   - Write integration tests for the checkout API endpoints

2. **Deployment**:
   - Run database migrations to create the new checkout tables
   - Deploy updated API with checkout functionality

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Update frontend components to use the checkout API
   - Implement checkout flow in the user interface
   - Create checkout management views for admin users

4. **Observability**:
   - Add logging for important checkout operations
   - Monitor checkout conversion rates and abandonment

5. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement checkout recovery emails for abandoned checkouts
   - Add support for saving/retrieving checkouts by unique URL
   - Implement checkout summary emails

## Checkout System Benefits

The new checkout system offers several advantages over the previous cart-based system:

1. **Complete State Management**: Maintains the full state of the checkout process, not just the items.
2. **Richer Customer Information**: Stores shipping, billing, and customer details directly with the checkout.
3. **Built-in Discount Handling**: Applies and validates discounts within the checkout context.
4. **Shipping Integration**: Selected shipping methods are tied directly to the checkout.
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Provides explicit states (active, completed, abandoned, expired) for better tracking.
6. **Improved Analytics**: Enables analysis of checkout completion rates and abandonment patterns.
7. **Direct Order Conversion**: Simplifies the process of converting a checkout to an order.

This implementation follows the project's Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between domain, application, and interface layers, ensuring maintainable and testable code.
